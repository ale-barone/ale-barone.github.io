      <description>This is a full text description of the poster I presented at the Doctoral Research Poster Showcase. This is intended to be a very general introduction for non practitioners. Experts can go directly to my latest conference proceedings.
Introduction Particle physics is the study of the tiniest elements in the whole Universe. Most of the subatomic particles gather together to form composite objects: some of these form the ordinary matter that we see and touch every day.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been awarded a JSPS Short-Term Fellowship to spend 4 months at KEK
(Tsukuba, Japan) to work on my research project
&amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;$B_{(s)}$ and $D_{(s)}$ mesons inclusive semi-leptonic decays from Lattice QCD&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;
together with Prof. Shoji Hashimoto and Prof. Takashi Kaneko.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I have succesfully organised my first conference &amp;ldquo;From Particle Physics to Gravitation: the Crossover with Data Science&amp;rdquo;, check the website!
The conference addressed the necessity of Data Science and High Performance Computers in Theoretical Physics, and covered topics from particle physics - such as phenomenology and lattice QCD - to gravitation and cosmology, with a particular focus on the application of techniques from fields like artificial intelligence, machine learning and data generation.</description>
